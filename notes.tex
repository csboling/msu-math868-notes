\chapter*{Preface}
These are (incomplete) lecture notes based closely on lectures by
Dr. Ben Schmidt at Michigan State University, Fall 2015 for the course
Math 868: Geometry and Topology I. The lectures follow fairly closely
after the textbook \href{https://www.springer.com/us/book/9781441973993}{An Introduction
  to Manifolds by Loring W. Tu}, published by Springer and available
as a PDF several places online. A notable exception is Chapter 4 on
Lie groups and Lie algebras, which was not covered due to time
constraints. At the time of this writing a syllabus for the course is
available at
\href{http://users.math.msu.edu/users/schmidt/syllabus-868f15.pdf}{http://users.math.msu.edu/users/schmidt/syllabus-868f15.pdf}.

These notes also omit some material which was covered in the lecture
but was not transcribed. In particular I believe the sections on bump
functions and flows on a vector field are missing. There are also
likely to be typos, typesetting issues, and technical mistakes, which
I am gradually attempting to correct. The latest version of the PDF is available
at \href{https://www.sharelatex.com/github/repos/csboling/msu-math868-notes}{https://www.sharelatex.com/github/repos/csboling/msu-math868-notes}.
